# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
# Also see https://github.com/github/gitignore for a set of rules applicable to many projects.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
# Some operating system rules should be placed here if everyone uses the same OS.
#   This ensures the rules apply to everyone as opposed to some individual machines.

/.bundle/cache

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
